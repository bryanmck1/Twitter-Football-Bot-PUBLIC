# Twitter-Football-Bot-PUBLIC
<br>
A Twitter bot that can tweet every goal and score update for a specified league. <br>
<br>

This bot can be easily configured to post updates for any football league of your choosing that SportMonks offers, of which there are over 1,300 leagues. <br>

All you have to do is update it with your SportMonks API key, Twitter API keys, and the ID number of the league you want. League ID's can be fetched from <a href="https://soccer.sportmonks.com/api/v2.0/leagues">this</a> endpoint. <br>

It uses just two API's: <br>
1. <a href="https://www.sportmonks.com/">SportMonks API</a>. A great, reliable source for tons of football data, as well as other sports.  <br>
2. <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en">Twitter API</a> <br>
<br>
